Usage: $0 OPTIONS ...

This script will configure, compile and install KRoC. It is intended for
use by end-users who have downloaded a KRoC source tree using
Subversion.  Options given to this script will be passed to KRoC's
configure script.

Common options:

  --prefix=DIRECTORY         Select directory to install into
                             (you must specify this; e.g. /usr/local)
  --with-toolchain=tvm       Build the Transterpreter toolchain
                             (default: build the KRoC toolchain)
  --enable-pony              Enable pony networking support

If you are working on KRoC itself, or building packages of it, you
should probably not use this script but instead use the regular
autotools commands.

Please report problems with KRoC to <$supportaddress>.
